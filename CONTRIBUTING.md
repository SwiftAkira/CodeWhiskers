## Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and organization
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Update documentation for any user-facing changes
- Write tests for new features
- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated modifications

## Adding Support for New Languages

To add support for a new programming language:

1. Update the `supportedLanguages` array in `src/parserModule.js`
2. Add language-specific parsing logic
3. Update the activation events in `package.json`
4. Test thoroughly with sample code in the new language

## Adding New Features

When adding a new feature, consider:

1. Does it align with the CodeWhiskers philosophy of making code understanding intuitive?
2. Will it maintain the kitten theme?
3. Is it optimized for performance?
4. Is it well documented?

1. Check if the issue already exists in the GitHub issue tracker
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - A clear title
   - A detailed description
