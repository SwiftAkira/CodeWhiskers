# CodeWhiskers üò∫

CodeWhiskers is a VS Code extension that helps developers quickly understand unfamiliar code through intuitive explanations, visualizations, and contextual insights. The extension uses a cute, kitten-themed UI with "whiskers" that represent how the tool analyzes and explores code structure.

## Features

### üê± Whisker Parsing
Visualize code structure with animated whisker-like lines that connect related code elements. Whiskers extend and retract as you explore different sections of code.

### üò∏ Curious Explanations
Get human-readable explanations of selected code blocks with varying levels of detail. A kitten icon indicates the complexity of the code.

### üêà Pounce Predictions
See function behavior predictions including inputs, outputs, and side effects when hovering over function references.

### üòª Purr Prompts
Receive subtle reminders to document your code, with increasing visibility for important sections.

### üêæ Paw Prints
Trace variable definitions, mutations, and usages with visual paw print paths through your code.
